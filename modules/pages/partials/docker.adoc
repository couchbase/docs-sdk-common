This SDK runs on top of the {cpp} core, Couchbase++, which requires a {cpp} 17 compiler, such as GCC 8.0, or more recent versions.
Centos 7 ships with an older version of GCC.

Workarounds are available for installing a newer build chain with https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/[EPEL], 
but this may not be within your company's policy, so also take a look at container options -- 
such as the unofficial Docker builds https://github.com/raycardillo/couchbase-dockerfiles[here], 
which can at least be used as a reference to a known working set-up, 
to attempt a version specific to your circumstances, and any subsequent change in dependencies.
