=== Atomicity Across Data Centers

If you are using xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-xdcr/xdcr-management-overview.adoc[Cross Data Center Replication] (XDCR), be sure to avoid modifying the same counter in more than one datacenter.
If the same counter is modified in multiple datacenters between replications, the counter will no longer be atomic, and its value can change in unspecified ways.

A counter must be incremented or decremented by only a single datacenter. 
Each datacenter must have its own set of counters that it uses -- a possible implementation would be including a datacenter name in the counter document ID.
