== Using DNS SRV records

As an alternative to specifying multiple hosts in your program, you can get the actual bootstrap node list from a DNS SRV record.
The following steps are necessary to make it work:

. Set up your DNS server to respond properly from a DNS SRV request.
. Enable it on the SDK and point it towards the DNS SRV entry.

Your DNS server should be set up like this (one row for each bootstrap node):

----
_couchbase._tcp.example.com.  3600  IN  SRV  0  0  11210  node1.example.com.
_couchbase._tcp.example.com.  3600  IN  SRV  0  0  11210  node2.example.com.
_couchbase._tcp.example.com.  3600  IN  SRV  0  0  11210  node3.example.com.
----

NOTE: The ordering, priorities and weighting are completely ignored and should not be set on the records to avoid ambiguities.

If you plan to use secure connections, you use `_couchbases` instead:

----
_couchbases._tcp.example.com.  3600  IN  SRV  0  0  11207  node1.example.com.
_couchbases._tcp.example.com.  3600  IN  SRV  0  0  11207  node2.example.com.
_couchbases._tcp.example.com.  3600  IN  SRV  0  0  11207  node3.example.com.
----
