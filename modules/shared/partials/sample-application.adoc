Discover how to program interactions with Couchbase Server 7.0 via the Data, Query, and Search services -- using the Travel Sample Application with the built-in Travel Sample data Bucket.
// end::abstract[]


// tag::quick-start[]
== Quick Start

Fetch the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/{travel-sample-git-project}[Couchbase {name-sdk} travel-sample Application REST Backend] from github:

[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/{travel-sample-git-project}.git
cd {travel-sample-git-project}
----

With https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker] installed, you should now be able to run a bare-bones copy of Couchbase Server, load the travel-sample, add indexes, install the sample-application and its frontend, all by running a single command:

[source,console]
----
docker-compose --profile local up
----
// end::quick-start[]


// tag::bring-your-own[]
== Running the code against your own development Couchbase server.

// tag::prereq[]
For Couchbase Server {version-server}, make sure that you have at least one node each of data; query; index; and search.
For a development box, mixing more than one of these on a single node (given enough memory resources) is perfectly acceptable.

If you have yet to install Couchbase Server in your development environment
xref:7.1@server:getting-started:do-a-quick-install.adoc[start here].

Then load up the Travel Sample Bucket, using either the
xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Web interface]
or the
xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli[command line].
You will also need to
xref:7.1@server:fts:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc#create-an-index[create a Search Index]
-- Query indexes are taken care of by the Sample Bucket.
// end::prereq[]

See the README at https://github.com/couchbaselabs/{travel-sample-git-project} for full details of how to run and tweak the {name-sdk} travel-sample app.

== Using the Sample App

image::sdk:shared:Travel-Sample-Register.png[]

Give yourself a username and password and click *Register*.

You can now try out searching for flights, booking flights, and searching for hotels.
You can see which Couchbase SDK operations are being executed by clicking the red bar at the bottom of the screen:

// tag::overview[]
== Sample App Overview

The sample application runs 3 docker containers which contain the following:

* The frontend -- a Vue web app which communicates with the backend via an API.
* The backend -- a Python web app which contains the SDK code to communicate with Couchbase Server.
* The database -- a one node cluster containing the travel sample Bucket and reqisite indexes.

The API implements a different endpoint for each of the app's features. You can explore the API here in read-only mode, or once you are running the application, at the `localhost:8080/apidocs` endpoint.
