= Capella Compatibility


// tag::cloud[]
Note, Capella is offered as a fully provisioned service, so the underlying version of Couchbase Server changes over time.
For this reason, compatibility information between Capella and the SDK is available xref:cloud:reference:sdk-compatibility.adoc[on the Capella compatibility page].
