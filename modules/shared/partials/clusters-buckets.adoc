= Buckets and Clusters
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
The Couchbase YYYYYYYYY SDK provides an API for managing a Couchbase cluster programmatically.

// tag::management[]
The primary means for managing clusters is through the xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Couchbase Web UI] which provides an easy to use interface for adding, removing, monitoring, and modifying buckets.
In some instances you may wish to have a programmatic interface.
For example, if you wish to manage a cluster from a setup script, or if you are setting up buckets in test scaffolding.

The SDK also comes with some convenience functionality for common Couchbase management requests -- see the xref:howtos:provisioning-cluster-resources.adoc[Provisioning Cluster Resources] guide.
// end::management[]

Management operations in the YYYYYYYYYYYYYYY SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:

== Creating and Removing Buckets

To create or delete a bucket, call the bucket manager with the `buckets()` call on the cluster:

[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("127.0.0.1", "user", "123456");
BucketManager manager = cluster.buckets();
manager.createBucket(bucketSettings);
----

// The `BucketSettings` can be created via a builder, [.api]`DefaultBucketSettings.builder()`.
This class is also used to expose information about an existing bucket (`manager.getBucket(string)`) or to update an existing bucket (`manager.updateBucket(bucketSettings)`).

The default Collection & Default Scope will be used automatically.
