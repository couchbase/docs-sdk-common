[abstract]
The standardized error codes returned by the Couchbase SDK, from cloud connection to sub-document.


// tag::intro[]
All exceptions derive from a common base Couchbase exception.
Exceptions (errors) are broken into different classifications:

* Shared Exceptions -- exceptions or errors thrown or returned by any service.
* Specific Exceptions -- exceptions or errors thrown by a service and specific to the service that threw or returned them.
* Internal Exceptions -- exceptions intended to be handled internally by the SDK and not exposed to the application.


The base exception, `CouchbaseException`, has two properties -- an `ErrorContext` and an optional _Cause_.
The `ErrorContext` provides extensive debugging information in JSON format.


Below are the exceptions, categorised by service.
// end::intro[]


== Shared Error Definitions
// tag::shared[]
ID Range: 1-99

=== # 1 Timeout

Raised when a request cannot be completed until the user-defined timeout fires.

Note, this is a base class for #13 and #14 (Ambiguous and Unambiguous).

=== # 2 RequestCanceled

Raised when a request is cancelled and cannot be resolved in a non-ambiguous way.
Most likely the request is in-flight on the socket and the socket gets closed.

=== # 3 InvalidArgument

Raised when it is unambiguously determined that the error was caused because of invalid arguments from the user.
Usually only thrown directly when doing request arg validation on KV and sub-doc.
Also commonly used as a parent class for many service-specific exceptions (see below).

=== # 4 ServiceNotAvailable

Raised when it can be determined from the config unambiguously that a given service is not available.
I.e. no query node in the config, or a memcached bucket is accessed and views or n1ql queries should be performed.

=== # 5 InternalServerFailure

Raised when:
* Query: xref:7.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-error-codes.adoc#5xxx-codes-exec[Error range 5xxx].
* Analytics: Error range xref:7.0@server:analytics:error-codes.adoc[25xxx].
* KV: error code ERR_INTERNAL (0x84).
* Search: HTTP 500.

=== # 6 AuthenticationFailure

Raised when:
* Query: xref:7.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-error-codes.adoc#10xxx-codes-ds_auth[Error range 10xxx].
* Analytics: Error range xref:7.0@server:analytics:error-codes.adoc[20xxx].
* View: HTTP status 401.
* KV: error code `ERR_ACCESS (0x24)`, `ERR_AUTH_ERROR (0x20)`, `AUTH_STALE (0x1f)`.
* Search: HTTP status 401, 403.

=== # 7 TemporaryFailure

Raised when:
* Analytics: Errors: xref:7.0@server:analytics:error-codes.adoc[23000, 23003].
* KV: Error code `ERR_TMPFAIL (0x86)`, `ERR_BUSY (0x85)` `ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY (0x82)`, `ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED (0x25)`.

=== # 8 ParsingFailure

Raised when:
* Query: xref:7.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-error-codes.adoc#3xxx-codes-parse[code 3000].
* Analytics: code xref:7.0@server:analytics:error-codes.adoc[24000] raised.

=== # 9 CasMismatch

Raised when:
* KV: `ERR_EXISTS (0x02)` when replace or remove with CAS.
* Query: xref:7.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-error-codes.adoc#12xxx-codes-ds_cb[code 12009].

=== # 10 BucketNotFound

Raised when a request is made but the current bucket is not found.

=== # 11 CollectionNotFound

Raised when a request is made but the current collection (including scope) is not found.

=== # 12 UnsupportedOperation

Raised when:
* KV: `0x81` (unknown command), `0x83` (not supported).

=== # 13 AmbiguousTimeout

Raised when a timeout occurs and we aren’t sure if the underlying operation has completed.
This normally occurs because we sent the request to the server successfully, but timed out waiting for the response.
Note that idempotent operations should never return this, as they do not have ambiguity.

=== # 14 UnambiguousTimeout

Raised when a timeout occurs and we are confident that the operation could not have succeeded.
This normally would occur because we received confident failures from the server, or never managed to successfully dispatch the operation.

=== # 15 FeatureNotAvailable

Raised when a feature which is not available was used.

=== # 16 ScopeNotFound

Raised when a management API attempts to target a scope which does not exist.

=== # 17 IndexNotFound

Raised when:
* Query:
** Codes xref:7.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-error-codes.adoc#12xxx-codes-ds_cb[12004, 12016].
** xref:7.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-error-codes.adoc#5000-9999-codes-errors[Codes 5000] AND message contains index .+ not found.
* Analytics: rised when xref:7.0@server:analytics:error-codes.adoc[24047] raised.
* Search: Http status code 400 AND text contains "index not found".

=== # 18 IndexExists

** xref:7.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-error-codes.adoc#5000-9999-codes-errors[Code 5000] AND message contains Index .+ already exist
** xref:7.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-error-codes.adoc#4xxx-codes-plan[Code 4300] AND message contains index .+ already exist
* Analytics: Raised when xref:7.0@server:analytics:error-codes.adoc[24048] raised.

== Connecting to Cloud
// tag::cloud[]

Although  the SDK and client application should be located in the same LAN-like environment (or cloud availability zone), and this is the only network configuration supported, we recognise that this set-up may not be possible during development.
In particular, you may be developing against https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/index.html[Couchbase Capella] from a laptop in a small or home office, where DNS-SRV may cause problems.

In order for your application to connect to your cloud, Capella creates a special kind of DNS record, called a Service record, or DNS-SRV record.
DNS SRV records are widely supported and used frequently in systems like XMPP, and Kubernetes services.
Occasionally, some DNS providers can run into issues with large DNS SRV records.
This can manifest as a host not found issue.
The actual problem is (a typically older) DNS server that cannot handle large responses which converts the error to host not found.
This has frequently been observed when working from home with a service provider router that embeds a caching DNS Server.

Below is a list of log messages that you may see if you hit DNS SRV issues.
These examples have been created in the circumstance that the SRV record is too long for the DNS provider to handle,
and are included here so that they are findable by search, and you can then go to our xref:howtos:troubleshooting-cloud-connections.adoc#troubleshooting-host-not-found[cloud connection troubleshooting page].
