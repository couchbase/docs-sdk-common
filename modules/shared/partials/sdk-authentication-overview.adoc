= Authentication

[abstract]
RBAC requires that users pass appropriate _credentials_ to Couchbase Server in order to access cluster-resources.
The SDK provides enhanced support for the passing of credentials.

== RBAC and the SDK

Couchbase Server 5.0 Enterprise Edition introduces _Role-Based Access Control_.
This ensures that cluster-resources can only be accessed by _users_ with appropriate _privileges_.
Privileges are grouped in Couchbase-defined sets; and each set is associated with a specific _role_.
Users can each be assigned one or more roles, and are thereby granted the privileges associated with each role.

In order to access cluster-resources, programs, including those supported by the Couchbase SDK, must authenticate with Couchbase Server, and so be identified as existing users, each associated with one or more roles.
Authentication requires the passing of _credentials_; which consist of a _username_ and (in most cases) a _password_.
Users may be defined either locally to Couchbase Server, or externally (for example, by means of an LDAP server).

Once authentication has succeeded, an _authorization_ process checks the roles associated with the identified user.
If role-associated privileges correspond to the level of resource-access requested by the user, access is duly granted; otherwise, it is denied.

== Authenticating with Legacy SDK Versions

For versions of Couchbase Server 5.0 and beyond, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is applied to all cluster-resources.
Under RBAC, bucket-passwords are no longer used: instead, a username and user-password must be specified.

All pre-RBAC versions of the SDK can continue to be used with Couchbase Server 5.0 and beyond: the pre-RBAC authentication procedure need not change.
However, when passed:

* The value formerly interpreted as a bucket-name is now interpreted as a username.
The username must correspond to a user defined on the cluster that is being accessed.
* The value formerly interpreted as a bucket-password is now interpreted as the password of the defined user.

Note that on Couchbase Server 5.0 and beyond, the only buckets that can be accessed without a user-password are those that were created on legacy versions of the server; were not originally created with a bucket-password; and continue to be available on 5.0 and beyond, following the required upgrade process.
See xref:6.0@server:learn:security/upgrading-to-rbac.adoc[Upgrading to RBAC] for information on server-upgrade to 5.0, and how this affects access to legacy buckets.

On Couchbase Server 5.0 and beyond, for any bucket to be accessed successfully, the defined user attempting access must have been assigned appropriate roles.
See xref:6.0@server:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles] for information on user-management.
