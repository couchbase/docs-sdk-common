= Flushing Buckets

[#management-intro]
// tag::management-intro[]
The primary means for managing clusters is through the Couchbase Web UI which provides an easy to use interface for adding, removing, monitoring and modifying buckets.
In some instances you may wish to have a programmatic interface.
For example, if you wish to manage a cluster from a setup script, or if you are setting up buckets in test scaffolding.
// end::management-intro[]

[#after-creation]
// tag::after-creation[]
Once the bucket has been created, you must wait for it to become ready.
This is because the bucket is actually created in the background.
You may need to wait some time until the bucket becomes ready by repeatedly trying to connect to it, until it succeeds.
// end::after-creation[]

[#update-bucket-warning]
// tag::update-bucket-warning[]
WARNING: Note that any property that is not explicitly set when building the bucket settings will use the default value.
In the case of the update, this is not necessarily the currently configured value, so you should be careful to set all properties to their correct expected values when updating an existing bucket configuration.
// end::update-bucket-warning[]

[#flush-intro]
// tag::flush-intro[]
When a bucket is flushed, all content is removed.
Because this operation is potentially dangerous it is disabled by default for each bucket.
Bucket flushing may be useful in test environments where it becomes a simpler alternative to removing and creating a test bucket.
You may enable bucket flushing on a per-bucket basis using the Couchbase Web Console or when creating a bucket.

[#index-management]
// tag::index-management[]
You can create and drop N1QL indexes using the SDK.
This is especially useful when setting up new applications, or simply when ensuring that a given bucket has certain indexes defined.
Indexes can be defined using actual N1QL statements or by using convenience functions within the SDK.
// end::index-management[]

[#ddoc-intro]
// tag::ddoc-intro[]
You can create, delete, retrieve, and publish design documents (used for MapReduce views) using the SDK.
This is useful when setting up new applications, updating view definitions, or running tests.
// end::ddoc-intro[]

[#ddoc-async-warning]
// tag::ddoc-async-warning[]
NOTE: Management APIs are considered to be asynchronous, which means you may need to wait some time (or poll manually) until the design document becomes available.
This is done by repeatedly querying the newly created view until it no longer fails with a _not found_ error.
// end::ddoc-async-warning[]

[#view-management]
// tag::view-management[]
Views are stored in design documents.
The SDK provides convenient methods to create, retrieve, and remove design documents.
To set up views, you create design documents that contain one or more view definitions, and then insert the design documents into a bucket.
Each view in a design document is represented by a name and a set of MapReduce functions.
The mandatory map function describes how to select and transform the data from the bucket, and the optional reduce function describes how to aggregate the results.
// end::view-management[]

[#one-view-update-warning]
// tag::one-view-update-warning[]
[WARNING]
====
When you want to update an existing document with a new view (or a modification of a view's definition), you can use the `upsertDesignDocument` method.

However, this method needs the list of views in the document to be exhaustive, meaning that if you just create the new view definition as previously and add it to a new `DesignDocument` that you upsert, all your other views will be erased!

The solution is to perform a `getDesignDocument`, add your view definition to the DesignDocument's views list, then upsert it.
This also works with view modifications, provided the change is in the `map` or `reduce` functions (just reuse the same name for the modified `View`), or for deletion of one out of several views in the document.

// tag::index-management-intro[]
In general, you will rarely need to work with Index Managers from the SDK.
For those occasions when you do, index management operations can be performed with the following interfaces:

* {query-api-reference}
* {analytics-api-reference}
* {search-api-reference}
* {view-api-reference}

You will find some of these described in the following section.
// end::index-management-intro[]

// tag::query-index-manager-intro[]
Applications can use this manager to perform operations such as creating, deleting, and fetching _primary_ or _secondary_ indexes:

* A _Primary_ index is based off a document's key and is mostly suited for simple queries.

* A _Secondary_ index is the most commonly used type, and is suited for complex queries that require filtering on document fields.

NOTE: To perform query index operations, the provided user must either be an _Admin_ or assigned the _Query Manage Index_ role.
See the xref:server:learn:security/roles.adoc#query-manage-index[Roles] page for more information.
