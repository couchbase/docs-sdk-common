=== Constrained Network Environments

Though xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#network-requirements[wide area network] (WAN) connections are not directly supported, some development and non-critical operations activities across a WAN are convenient.
These settings are some you may want to consider adjusting:

* Connect Timeout to 30s
* Key-Value Timeout to 5s
* Config Poll Interval to 10s
* Circuit Breaker ErrorThresholdPercentage to 75

A program using the SDK can also use the `waitUntilReady()` API call to handle all connection negotiations and realted errors at one place.
It may be useful to block in, for example, a basic console testing application for up to 30 seconds before proceeding in the program to perform data operations.
See the API reference for further details.
