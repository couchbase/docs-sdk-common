= Couchbase SDK Common Documentation

This repository hosts the common documentation files for the Couchbase SDKs.

== Versioning

This repository is versioned to track the version of Couchbase Server (e.g., release/5.5, release/6.0, etc).
The component version is defined in the component descriptor, _antora.yml_.
References from this repository to pages in the Couchbase Server documentation should mostly stick to this version.

Unlike other documentation repositories that track the Couchbase Server version, this repository is not a hard dependency of the Couchbase Server documentation.
Instead, this repository is consumed by the documentation for the language-specific SDKs.

== Component Name

The common SDK component identifies as `sdk`.
The component name is defined in the component descriptor, _antora.yml_.
This name should be used in any IDs that refer to files in this repository.

== Repository Structure

The files and directories in this repository are organized as an auxilary Antora documentation component.
That means this repository doesn't contribute any pages to the documentation directly.
Instead, it provides a) partial files (both complete pages and page fragments) which can be included into pages from another component and b) shared images that those pages can reference.

At a high level, this repository contains two modules, which serve two distinct purposes:

* pages
* shared

The *pages* module (not to be confused with Antora's pages folder), contains complete pages in the form of partials.
These partials are the common pages shared by all the Couchbase SDKs.

The *shared* module contains page fragments, also in the form of partials.
These partials hold information common to all the Couchbase SDKs, but which do not constitute complete pages.

=== Pages Module

The pages module has the following structure starting from the root of the repository:

....
modules/
  pages/
    partials/
      *.adoc
    assets/
      images
        *.png
....

Although the AsciiDoc files are located in the [.path]_partials_ folder, they are, in fact, complete pages.
The only reason they're located in the [.path]_partials_ folder is so that they don't get turned into pages directly.
Instead, they need to be included into pages in the language-specific SDKs.

==== Usage

One example is the "`Sample Application`" page, located in this repository at [.path]_modules/pages/partials/sample-application.adoc_.
To promote this common page to a concrete page in one of the language-specific SDKs, create the following file in that SDK and populate it with a single include directive, as follows:

.modules/ROOT/pages/sample-application.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::6.0@sdk:pages:partial$sample-application.adoc[]
----

The include directive effectively imports the common page into a page in the language-specific SDK documentation.
Every common page must have a corresponding master page in every language-specific SDK.

==== Page References

All page references in the common page are assumed to be relative to the module in which the page is included (i.e., relative to the master page).
Thus, the reference `+xref:n1ql-query.adoc[Querying with N1QL]+` refers to the [.path]_n1ql-query.adoc_ page in the same module as [.path]_sample-application.adoc_ master page in the language-specific SDK.

References to all other locations, such as to server, must provide the necessary context (component, version, module, etc).

All the common pages include a shared attributes file, [.path]_modules/pages/partials/attributes.adoc_

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
\include::partial$attributes.adoc[]

...
----

The attributes file controls the version of Couchbase Server (`version-server`) as well as the path to shared images (`incimagesdir`), which will get to in the next section.

The `version-server` attribute is used in the common pages to refer to pages in the Couchbase Server documentation.
For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
Use the xref:{version-server}@server:tools:query-workbench.adoc[Query Workbench] to issue queries using the web console.
----

Using the attributes file allows the server version to be managed in a single place.

==== Image References

Using images in the common folders is a little tricky because Antora doesn't yet support image references outside the current module (nor does the include cause the context to change).
Therefore, it's necessary to employ a workaround.

To workaround this limitation in Antora, the location of images in common pages is controlled using a shared attribute named `incimagesdir`.
Here's how you'll use it to specify the location of images in these common pages:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::{incimagesdir}/travel-app-narration.png[]
----

_This is the only time in Antora you would use an attribute reference at the start of an image target._

The `incimagesdir` attribute is defined in the attributes file, [.path]_modules/pages/partials/attributes.adoc_.
The value of this attribute refers to the relative path to the images folder in the pages module (though it has to do a bit of a reach to get there).

You don't have to worry about any of these details as long as you prefix the image target with `{incimagesdir}` for now.

=== Shared Module

The shared module has the following structure starting from the root of the repository:

....
modules/
  shared/
    partials/
      *.adoc
....

This module is a little easier to understandn because it contains partials which really are partials (i.e., page fragments).
These partials can be included into any page in the language-specific SDK documentation to provide shared content such as reference sections, explanations, definitions, phrases, etc.

Although not required, the content in these partials is often selected using a tag or tags.

==== Usage

One example is the introduction to views in the file [.path]_modules/ROOT/pages/view-queries-with-sdk.adoc_ for a language-specific SDK.

[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::6.0@sdk:shared:partial$views.adoc[tag=views-intro]
----

This imports a page fragment that looks like the following:

[source,asciidoc]
-----
// tag::views-intro[]
--
The normal CRUD methods allow you to look up a document by its ID.
...

TIP: See xref:6.0@server:understanding-couchbase:views/views-intro.adoc[Views].
--
// end::views-intro[]
-----

All the lines between `tag::views-intro[]` and `end::views-intro[]` get imported into the page.

==== Page References

Like the common pages, all page references in shared partials are assumed to be relative to the module in which the partial is included.
Thus, the reference `+xref:n1ql-query.adoc[Querying with N1QL]+` refers to the [.path]_n1ql-query.adoc_ page in the same module as [.path]_sample-application.adoc_ in the language-specific SDK.

References to all other locations, such as to server, must provide the necessary context (component, version, module, etc).

Unlike the common pages, the partials do not import a shared attributes file.
That's because partials can be included partially and thus bypass attributes defined in the document header.
Unfortunately, that means that the references in the share partials to the server have to be hard-coded for now.

[source,asciidoc]
----
See xref:6.0@server:understanding-couchbase:views/views-intro.adoc[Views].
----

==== Image References

Currently, the shared module doesn't contain any images.
If they are added, a different workaround will have to be developed since not all partials would pick up a shared attributes file.
